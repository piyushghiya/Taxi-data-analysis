Project Choice –
We have selected the project area – “exploring NYC Taxi Trips”.
We would use the following datasets –

+	Yellow/Green Taxi Data
+	Taxi Data
+	Uber Data
+	CitiBike Data
+	Demographics

We are also planning to work with Stock Data and study various patterns.

Tasks to be carried out –

+	Analyzing the taxi data to find statistical models, like Regions with large number of drop offs at morning peak hours to find work areas.
+	To give other statistics such as time interval of the day when maximum taxis are used, areas with least taxi drop offs.
+	Most popular taxi destinations such as tourist places.
+	Taxi usage distribution over different seasons.
+	Analyze Weather Information and co-relate with Taxi usage
+	Mode of transport preferred by residents, eg. citibikes, taxis.
+	Studying the Distances for Uber, NYC taxi, and CItibike. By doing this we may find a pattern such as for small distances residents prefer Citibike.
+	Studying the stock prices for NYC cabs and Uber to find any pattern or impact of on each other.
+	To create a website to visualize the data
